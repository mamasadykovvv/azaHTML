CS GO
<br>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) expands
<br>upon the team-based action gameplay that it
<br>pioneered when it was launched 19 years ago. CS:
<br>GO features new maps, characters, weapons, and
<br>game modes, and delivers updated versions of the
<br>classic CS content (de_dust2, etc.).
